<h1>CRUD-TODO</h1>

Using Vite + React and React Router DOM, I have created a webpage. The webpage showcases my favorite books on my bookshelves at home, allowing you to sort them alphabetically from A-Z and Z-A. In the 'Details' section, you can explore details such as author, year, and page count.
